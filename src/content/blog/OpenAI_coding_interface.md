# Open AI, a new interface of ChatGPT for Coding !

OpenAI recently launched a beta version of Canvas, a new feature that could be relevant! This feature is about having an interface in ChatGPT to be able to code in it. OpenAI shared their will to go beyond the limitation of only chatting with this AI and offering a side-by-side interface.

The classical interface to chat with ChatGPT is enough to ask it basic questions like: "What's the half of 20?" for example, but when you want to have a serious and IT conversation with it by providing a block of code, it becomes tough.

If you ask ChatGPT to generate you a little HTML page with only a centralised button and a text, this is a piece of cake for it, but when you ask it to do a change in a related file with connection to others, GPT is lost...


This interface helps to edit and revise the code by highlighting the specific section that the user indicates to it. The user tells what he wants from this AI so it can focus on it. The benefit of this practice is to give inline feedbacks and suggestions with the entire project in GPT's mind.

This toughtful and useful feature is only available for the riches who pay the GPT-4o, the canva can be selected from the model picker. This opens immediately when GPT understands the question. In addition, adding the "use canva" in the prompt will trigger it.

To be more precise, here are the benefits : 
- code reviews
- adds logs, helps debug and understands code
- detects bugs and fixes them by rewriting instead of the user
- only for : JS, TSX, PY, Java, C++ or PHP.

OpenAI pretends that GPT-4o is more accurate than previous versions, espacially in non-English languages such as GOTO++ which is a Japanese programming language.

It's useful to know that OpenAI has added the ability to detect categories such as hate, violence, self harm and other new categories. 

OpenAi wrote *"We hope today’s upgrades help more developers benefit from the latest research and investments in our safety systems."*

This modertion API is even used by Grammarly to ensure that its output is fair and safe. ElevenlLabs uses it too, to scan content generated by their audio AI products.

Grammarly is a cloud-based typing assistant, it reviews grammar, spelling, vocabulary  and so on.
ElevenLabs is a voice generator that delivers human high-quality speech in 32 languages.
