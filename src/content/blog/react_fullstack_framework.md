# React, a Full Stack Framework? 

What is React ? 
React is an open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components created by Facebook. 

Adding React Server Component and Server Action,  React becomes a full-stack framework.

The software engineer,Robin Wiereuch wrote: *"As developers start to access databases directly through Server Components and Server Actions, there will be a learning curve ahead to tame the complexities beyond simple CRUD applications."*
He also said that frontend developers will quickly start to learn backend architectures with best practices, layers, and design patterns.

#### Claude AI and generation of Artifacts.

Claude AI has a dedicated window for given artifact. This is in a separate window to be able to see the code on one side and in the other to make architecture diagrams from codebases.

This AI can also create: 
- Flowcharts
- SVG graphics
- Inster an image
- Interactive dashboards
- Code snippets
- Single page website in React or HTML



#### Catching bugs in TypeScript

A potential version of TypeScript (5.6) is out. This version spot nullish or truthy erros. The new TypeScript introduces also a new type which is *"IteratorObject"*, and for parity we have the *"AsynIteratorObject"* type.

The product Manager of TypeScript wrote: *"AsyncIterator does not yet exist as a runtime value in JavaScript that brings the same methods for AsyncIterables, but it is an active proposal and this new type prepares for it"*
